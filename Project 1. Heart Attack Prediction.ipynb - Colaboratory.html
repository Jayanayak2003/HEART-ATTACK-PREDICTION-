Step-by-step guide to create and run your "Heart Attack Prediction" project using "Logistic Regression" in "Google Colab":

 Step 1: Set Up Your Google Colab Environment
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on "New Notebook" to create a new project.

 Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries
In your Colab notebook, start by importing the necessary libraries for data handling, model training, and evaluation.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

Step 3: Load the Dataset
Assume you have a "heart attack dataset" (e.g., CSV format). You can upload it directly in Google Colab or mount your Google Drive if your file is stored there.

To upload the file:
1. In Colab, click the folder icon on the left sidebar.
2. Upload your dataset (e.g., "heart.csv").

Load the dataset:

```python
# Load dataset
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('heart.csv')
df.head()  # Preview the dataset
```

 Step 4: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (if any) and split the data into features (X) and target (y).

```python
# Checking for missing values
df.isnull().sum()

# Splitting features and target variable
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)  # Features (everything except the target)
y = df['target']  # Target variable (e.g., '1' for heart attack risk, '0' for no risk)

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Step 5: Train Logistic Regression Model
Train the logistic regression model on the training data.

```python
# Initialize Logistic Regression model
logreg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Train the model
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)
```

Step 6: Evaluate the Model
After training the model, evaluate its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

```python
# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

# Display confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()
```
Step 7: Run the Colab Notebook
1. Click the **Run** button (play icon) next to each code cell to execute them step by step.
2. The model will be trained, and after execution, youâ€™ll see the accuracy and confusion matrix plotted.

Step 8: Save and Share Your Colab Project
1. Once your project is complete, you can save it directly to your Google Drive or download it as a `.ipynb` file.
2. You can share the Colab project by clicking on "Share" (top-right corner) and adjusting the access permissions to make it public or share it with specific people.

Summary of Key Steps:
1. "Set up Google Colab": Create a new notebook and import necessary libraries.
2. "Load dataset": Upload your dataset (e.g., heart.csv) and load it into a DataFrame.
3. "Preprocess data": Split the dataset into training and test sets.
4. "Train model": Train a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn.
5. "Evaluate model": Check the accuracy and plot the confusion matrix.
6. "Run & share": Run the notebook and share it from Google Colab.

This guide will help you create a simple "Heart Attack Prediction" project using "Logistic Regression" in Google Colab.
