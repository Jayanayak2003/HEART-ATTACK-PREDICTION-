❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project is a basic implementation of heart attack risk prediction using Logistic Regression, compiled and executed in Google Colab.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
Model: Applied Logistic Regression to classify individuals as either at risk or not at risk of a heart attack.
Evaluation: Used accuracy and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas and NumPy for data handling
Scikit-learn for implementing Logistic Regression
Google Colab for easy and interactive model development
Objective:
To build a simple yet effective model that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical and health-related data.
